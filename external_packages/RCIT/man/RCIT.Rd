\title{RCIT and RCoT - tests whether x and y are conditionally independent given z. Calls RIT if z is empty.}
\usage{
RCIT(x, y, z = NULL, approx = "lpd4", corr = TRUE, num_f = 25,
  seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Random variable x.}

\item{y}{Random variable y.}

\item{z}{Random variable z.}

\item{approx}{Method for approximating the null distribution. Options include:
"lpd4," the Lindsay-Pilla-Basak method (default),
"gamma" for the Satterthwaite-Welch method,
"hbe" for the Hall-Buckley-Eagleson method,
"chi2" for a normalized chi-squared statistic,
"perm" for permutation testing (warning: this one is slow but recommended for small samples generally <500 )}

\item{corr}{TRUE corresponds to RCoT and FALSE to RCIT. Default is TRUE.}

\item{num_f}{Number of features for conditioning set. Default is 25.}

\item{seed}{The seed for controlling random number generation. Use if you want to replicate results exactly. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing the p-value \code{p} and statistic \code{Sta}
}
